# Employee Tracker

Completed By Joshua Diaz


# Project Description:

In this assignment, I created an employee tracker application that would allow the user to view employees, departments, and different roles that employees could be assigned. Also the user would have the ability to add a new employee, department, and role if they so choose to do so. Technologies used in this assignment are node.js, express, and MySQL.
